## Features
* One click install and run script
* In-TouchDesigner inference
  
## Usage
Tested with TouchDesigner 2023.11340 & Python 3.11

#### Install:
1. Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)
2. Install [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive) 11.8
3. Download [TDDepthAnything](https://github.com/olegchomp/TDDepthAnything/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) repository
4. Open ```accelerate.bat``` with text editor and set path to Python 3.11 in ```set PYTHON_PATH=```. (ex. ```set PYTHON_PATH="C:\Program Files\Python311\python.exe"```)
5. Run ```accelerate.bat```

> [!TIP]
> You can use same .venv for TDDepthAnything & [TouchDiffusion](https://github.com/olegchomp/TouchDiffusion).

#### Accelerate models:
1. Download [Depth-Anything model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/tree/main/checkpoints) or [Depth-Anything v2 model](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-trained-models)
2. Copy model to ```checkpoints``` folder
3. Run ```accelerate.bat```
4. Select model version (1 - Depth-Anything, 2 - Depth-Anything v2)
5. Select model size (s - small, b - base, l - large, g - giant)
6. Select width & height (default is 518x518)
7. Wait for acceleration to finish
#### TouchDesigner inference:
1. Add TDDepthAnything.tox to project
2. On ```Settings``` page change path to ```TDDepthAnything``` folder and click Re-init
3. On ```Depth Anything``` page select path to engine file (for ex. ```engines/depth_anything_vits14.engine```) and click Load Engine
